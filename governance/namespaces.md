# Namespace Governance for 3.0.0-rc.1

Namespaces prevent one narrative system or workflow from silently changing another.

## Candidate reservations

- `ncp:` identifies NCP Core vocabulary maintained through the NCP change process.
- `dramatica:` identifies NCP's foundational Dramatica Storyform Profile, maintained by The Dramatica Co. Changes to the official profile require its approval.
- `ncp-interactive:` and `ncp-production:` are reserved candidate extension namespaces. They remain outside `dramatica:`.

Third parties may create separately named and governed profiles or extensions, including mappings such as `hero-journey:` or `save-the-cat:`. A mapping remains a mapping and must not redefine fields in another namespace.

## Change requirements

Every accepted change to a maintained namespace identifies:

- the affected namespace and version;
- whether the change is backward compatible;
- migration or deprecation behavior;
- synthetic positive and negative examples; and
- structural validation coverage when a schema is available.

Consumers should preserve unknown declared namespaces and payloads where practical rather than reinterpreting or deleting them.

This technical reservation prevents semantic drift. The boundary between open interchange, maintained namespaces, licensed services, and mark permissions is documented in [Licensing and Commercial Access](licensing.md).
